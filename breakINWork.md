# WordPress MCP Server Project Summary

Working on enhancing the security architecture of a WordPress MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server project. This server provides a standardized interface for AI systems to interact with WordPress sites through JSON-RPC 2.0. Here's our current status:

## Current Progress

1. **Analysis of Existing Codebase**:
   - Examined the logging system in `src/utils/logger.ts`
   - Reviewed the metrics system in `src/utils/monitoring/index.ts`
   - Identified key security enhancement opportunities

2. **Security Enhancement Planning**:
   - Created a methodical approach for implementing security audit logging
   - Documented plans for extending the existing infrastructure rather than replacing it
   - Outlined integration points with the current codebase

3. **Proposed Security Features**:
   - Security audit logging to track security-relevant events
   - Enhanced monitoring metrics for security events
   - HTTPS enforcement (planned but not yet designed in detail)
   - Enhanced rate limiting (planned but not yet designed in detail)
   - Configuration validation (planned but not yet designed in detail)

## Development Philosophy

Follow a thoughtful, methodical approach to security enhancements:

1. **Review First**: Thoroughly analyzing existing code before making changes
2. **Design Before Implementation**: Planning each enhancement with careful consideration
3. **Build on Existing Infrastructure**: Extending rather than replacing current systems
4. **Maintain Backward Compatibility**: Ensuring existing code continues to work
5. **Incremental Approach**: Making focused, targeted changes one at a time

## Next Steps

1. Finalize the design for security audit logging enhancements
2. Implement and test the logging enhancements
3. Move on to additional security features using the same methodical approach:
   - HTTPS enforcement
   - Enhanced rate limiting
   - Configuration validation
   - API key management improvements

This approach ensures a stable, working system while progressively enhancing security features in a controlled, deliberate manner.
